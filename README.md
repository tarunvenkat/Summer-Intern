# Summer-Intern

The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that could predict future pandemic cases  around the world. To develop such a model, a literature study alongside an experiment is set to identify a suitable algorithm. To assess the features that impact the prediction model.

Performed data analysis and plotted some graphs by which we can visulaise the dataset

Created and Developed a model using Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression ,Machine Learning Models

Later on developed it using time series holt linear prediction model
